# Write a class called Rock_paper_scissors that implements the logic of the game Rock paper-
# scissors. For this game the user plays against the computer for a certain number of rounds.
# Your class should have fields for the how many rounds there will be, the current round number,
# and the number of wins each player has. There should be methods for getting the computerâ€™s
# choice, finding the winner of a round, and checking to see if someone has one the (entire)
# game. You may want more methods.
